Donut Wisdom WCF

A WCF service for one of the tastiest man-made foods on Earth - DONUTS!

The WCF service solution has two parts:

1. DonutWisdomService
2. DonutWisdomManager

* DonutWisdomService is the WCF service. It's a little service with a list of donut wisdom quotes (e.g. "A balanced diet is a donut in each hand", and so on ;)
* DonutWisdomManager is a console app that allows a user to add a donut wisdom quote to the above list... at least, that's the goal (it won't update the list currently since the functionality isn't written *yet*)
